# Project: Azure Devops projects and repositories in Business Central

## Overview

This repository hosts the source code for the project "Azure Devops projects and repositories in Business Central", a specialized solution designed for Dynamics 365 Business Central.
The initiative aims to integrate Business Central with Azure Devops, allowing us to view Azure Devops entities from Business Central.

## Features

- Configure the personal access token obtained from the Azure Devops organization.
- View Azure Devops organizations, projects, and repositories.
- View commits, branches, pull requests and pushes from repositories.


## Usage

To start the integration we need to configure a PAT (personal access token) <br>

You must access the Azure Devops PAT Setup page to configure the tokens.

Subsequently, you must access the Azure Devops Organizations page, and from there you begin to browse the projects, repositories and other functionalities.
